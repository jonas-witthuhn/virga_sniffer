# Introduction
The Virga-Sniffer is a tool to detect *virga* (precipitation which completely evaporates before reaching the surface).
As input source **radar reflectivity** and **ceilometer cloud-base height** observation are mandatory. Optionally but highly recommended are the additional information of **radar doppler velocity**, **lifting condensation level** and **surface rain detection**.
